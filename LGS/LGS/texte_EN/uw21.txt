Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds is the second installment of the Underworld series and the eleventh in the entire series. It was developed by Looking Glass Studios and published by Origin for the IBM-PC in 1992. For its design and production, it took 9 months of work from the company, unlike its predecessor, which has been developed over two years. The team sought to improve upon the foundation laid by the game's predecessor, particularly by increasing the size and interactivity of the game world.
