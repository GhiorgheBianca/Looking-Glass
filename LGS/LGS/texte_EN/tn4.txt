Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri was noted for the team battles in a three-dimensional, complex universe, rarely seen until 1996. Despite that Looking Glass Studios made mistakes at that time, it managed to get things done and bring on the market a well-worked product, with great mechanics and a beautiful science-fiction design, their creation being appreciated by the community later.
