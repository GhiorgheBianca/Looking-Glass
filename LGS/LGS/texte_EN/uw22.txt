Ultima Underworld II is much more complex and larger than its predecessor, Ultima Underworld. Its story is now an integral part of the main Ultimas story line, with another plan of the Guardian to attack and conquer Britannia. Through the game some light is shed on the history of the evil mastermind behind these plans. 

A year has gone by since Ultima VII and Lord British is inviting many people, including the Avatar, to a party to celebrate the reconstruction after the crisis. But the next morning, disaster strikes. The Guardian attacks and traps Castle Britannia with all people within a Blackrock Dome, paralyzing the land. The Player as the Avatar descends into the sewers beneath the castle, where a strange, big jewel is found, enabling travel to other worlds. These worlds have already fallen prey to the Guardian, either conquered or outright destroyed. The Avatar weakens the jewel by turning the Guardian's own magic against it and cutting its magical supply lines, while searching for a way to break the dome in the end.
