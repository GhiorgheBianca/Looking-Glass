Thief: The Dark Project is a 1998 first-person stealth video game developed by Looking Glass Studios and published by Eidos Interactive. Set in a medieval steampunk metropolis called the City, players take on the role of Garrett, a master thief trained by a secret society who, while stealing valuable objects, becomes embroiled in a complex plot that ultimately sees him attempting to prevent a great power from unleashing chaos on the world.

The City has been noted to contain elements of the Middle Ages-like dark fantasy and the Industrial Revolution. The initial concept was to make an action role-playing game and Levine was given the job of designing the game's world and story. Levine said the initial ideas and projects that have later morphed into Dark Camelot, before eventually evolving into The Dark Project. Dark Camelot, still focused on sword combat. Its plot (an inversion of Arthurian legend) featured Mordred as a misunderstood hero, King Arthur as a tyrannical villain and Merlin as a psychopath.
