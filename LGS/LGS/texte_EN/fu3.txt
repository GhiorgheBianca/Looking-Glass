Flight Unlimited III was the third and last of the Flight Unlimited series of General aviation flight simulators created by Looking Glass Studios, released in 1999. It included ten user-flyable aircraft in total, and several new features. In many ways, this simulator offers a vastly improved experience compared to the originally-released product (Flight Unlimited).

One of the most significant new features was the new weather engine. Before a flight the user could generate and manipulate weather fronts, which would then change dynamically while flying.

As with Flight Unlimited II, the simulator concentrated on one small but highly detailed part of the USA, in this version Seattle. It was once again sourced from USGS satellite photos and real-life elevation data. Outside of the Seattle area, covering more of the Pacific Northwest, was a less detailed area called the outer terrain region. AI controlled aircraft would populate the airspace and displayed all phases of a flight, from taxi and takeoff to landing. There were a large variety of aircraft, meaning the user could see airliners at larger airports as well as small private aircraft flying the traffic pattern at local private airfields. The simulator also came with a program called the Flight Unlimited Editor (FLED), which allowed the user to edit the simulator's scenery.
