Looking Glass Studios was an American computer game development company during the 1990s. Their games demonstrated innovative gameplay, pioneering physics simulation, and well-written, engaging stories. Their best known game franchises were Ultima Underworld, System Shock and Thief. In the '90s, PC development technology was limited compared to modern machines, and Looking Glass had modern design principles in mind. The studio spent much of its time trying to circumvent this barrier, and because of that, there wasn't much precedent to what it was doing; story-driven 3-D worlds were a thing of the future, and no one knew how to get there.
