The company originally formed as Looking Glass Technology in 1990, when 'Blue Sky Productions' and 'Lerner Research' merged. Originally based in Lexington, Massachusetts, in 1994 the company moved to Cambridge. A significant number of Looking Glass personnel were MIT graduates. Looking Glass gained industry renown for their 3D engine used in Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss and System Shock. In 1997, the company was renamed to Looking Glass Studios.

The idea behind the founding of Looking Glass became a possibility thanks to the first game Ultima Underworld, which began as a co-operation between the two original companies in the early 1990s. The development lasted for 2 years and resulted in the entry of a game that used a 3D, colorful design with a wide variety of rooms. The creation of Looking Glass has attracted the attention and support of many players, making it possible to continue the company's business.
