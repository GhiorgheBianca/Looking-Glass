British Open Championship Golf is a 1997 sports video game developed and published by Looking Glass Technologies. A simulation of The Open Championship, it allows the player to engage in multiple forms of golf, including stroke play and fourball. The player competes at reproductions of the Royal Troon Golf Club and the Old Course at St. Andrews as and against famous golfers of the time. Announcer commentary is provided by actor Michael Bradshaw and Wide World of Sports host Jim McKay.

British Open Championship Golf was a major economical and commercial failure and, as a result, Looking Glass had to stop publishing games designed by them. In spite of this, the game was appreciated by critics, having always positive reviews. They appreciated Jim McKay's commentary throughout matches, graphics and the atmosphere created by Looking Glass. On the opposite side, criticism was leveled against its lack of multiplayer or course creation functionality, and some reviewers found fault with its brevity.
