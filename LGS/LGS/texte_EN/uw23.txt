Ultima Underworld II is based on the same engine as Ultima Underworld, but with enhancements. The viewing window is now bigger, digital sound effects are implemented, the casting system is easier. The portraits of the people are now much better and bigger.

Ultima Underworld II was exclusively produced for the PC, therefore no other official ports of the game exist. A Japanese FM-Towns version was released, but it is almost identical to the original version, except for the language.
