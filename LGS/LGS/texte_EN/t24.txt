Thief II improves the formula of the first game, Looking Glass's last creation managing to take a huge step to an almost perfect game. Due to the increased attention to artificial intelligence, deep and well-thought-out levels and the diversity of the game itself, Thief II deserves its place in history as one of the best stealth games ever made, even though it has been 18 years since it was realised.
